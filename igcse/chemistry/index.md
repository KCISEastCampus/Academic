## Topic Test Revision Guide

Hi!

As the Topic Test is approaching, I will provide you with a revision guide. Before the Mock exam, I will also release a comprehensive revision guide for the entire subject to help you better prepare for the exam.

    - 8.1 Rate of Reaction
    - 8.2 Factors Affecting Equilibrium
    - 8.3 Production of Ammonia and Sulfuric Acid
    - 8.4 Redox Reactions

### Chapter 6

#### 6.4 Molar Concentrations

This section mainly explains **titration** and how to measure the concentration of a solution.

**Formula**:
Concentration (mol/dm<sup>3</sup>) = number of moles/volume of solution (dm<sup>3</sup>).

If the concentration of one reactant is known, the concentration of the other reactant can be determined through the results of **titration**.

### Chapter 8 - The Rate and Extent of Chemical Change

#### 8.1 Rate of Reaction

This section is very important, mainly discussing the factors that affect the rate of reaction. Below are the four key factors and their answering techniques:

| Factor          | Explanation                                                                                       | Answering Technique                                                                 |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Temperature** | Increasing temperature increases the speed of reactant particles, making collisions more frequent and energetic, thus speeding up the reaction rate. | Emphasize that temperature affects particle speed and collision frequency, thereby increasing the reaction rate. |
| **Pressure**    | Increasing the pressure of gaseous reactants increases the frequency of collisions, thus speeding up the reaction rate. | Emphasize that pressure increases collision frequency, thereby increasing the reaction rate. |
| **Concentration** | Increasing the concentration of reactants increases the frequency of collisions, thus speeding up the reaction rate. | Emphasize that concentration increases collision frequency, thereby increasing the reaction rate. |
| **Surface Area** | Increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the frequency of collisions, thus speeding up the reaction rate. | Emphasize that surface area increases collision frequency, thereby increasing the reaction rate. |

Additionally, **catalysts** are also an important factor affecting the reaction rate:

1. Catalysts can speed up the reaction rate, but they are **not consumed** in the process.
2. Different chemical reactions require different catalysts.

#### 8.2 Factors Affecting Equilibrium

This section is different from 8.1, mainly discussing the factors affecting **chemical equilibrium** rather than the reaction rate.

| Condition Change | Endothermic Reaction | Exothermic Reaction |
|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Temperature Increase** | Yield increases      | Yield decreases     |
| **Temperature Decrease** | Yield decreases      | Yield increases     |

For gaseous reactions:

- **Pressure Increase**: Favors the side with **fewer molecules**.
- **Pressure Decrease**: Favors the side with **more molecules**.

#### 8.3 Production of Ammonia and Sulfuric Acid

##### Production of Ammonia

Ammonia is produced through the **Haber Process**, with nitrogen and hydrogen as raw materials.

**Common Exam Questions**:

1. **Temperature Selection**:
    - This is an **exothermic reaction**, so lowering the temperature increases ammonia yield.
    - However, too low a temperature reduces the reaction rate, so a balance between yield and reaction rate is needed.
2. **Pressure Selection**:
    - Increasing pressure favors ammonia production (the side with fewer molecules).
    - However, high-pressure equipment is costly and poses safety risks.

##### Production of Sulfuric Acid

Sulfuric acid is produced through the **Contact Process**, which consists of three stages and uses **vanadium(V) oxide** as a catalyst.

Reaction Stages:

**Common Exam Questions**:

1. **Role of Catalyst**:
    - Catalysts speed up the reaction rate but are not consumed.

#### 8.4 Redox Reactions

The core of this section is the **OIL RIG** principle:
- **OIL**: Oxidation Is Losing electrons
- **RIG**: Reduction Is Gaining electrons

Understanding this principle is sufficient, as it may not be directly tested in the exam.

### Chapter 9 - Energy Changes

#### 9.1 Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions

| Reaction Type      | Energy Change                     | Examples                           |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Exothermic**  | Energy released to the surroundings            | Combustion, oxidation reactions, neutralization reactions       |
| **Endothermic**  | Energy absorbed from the surroundings            | Thermal decomposition, some cooling reactions           |

#### 9.2 Calculating and Explaining Energy Change

**Energy Calculation Formula**:
Q=mcΔT
- **Q**: Energy (unit: J)
- **m**: Mass (unit: kg)
- **c**: Specific heat capacity (unit: J/kg℃)
- **ΔT**: Temperature change (unit: ℃)

**Relationship between Bond Energy and Reaction Type**:

| Reaction Type      | Energy Change                                                                 |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Exothermic**  | Energy released from forming new bonds > Energy required to break old bonds                                   |
| **Endothermic**  | Energy required to break old bonds > Energy released from forming new bonds                                   |

#### 9.3 Chemical Cells and Fuel Cells

This section requires understanding and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of different fuels. For example:

| Fuel Type | Advantages                                      | Disadvantages                                      |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Oil** | High energy density, easy to store and transport                | Pollutes the environment, limited resources                        |
| **Hydrogen** | Clean energy, combustion product is only water                  | High storage and transportation costs, lower energy density            |

This concludes the revision for this Chemistry Topic Test. I hope all of you can achieve good results!
