# Welcome

Welcome to the new Student Council news section. Here we will post updates about events, initiatives, and important announcements.

## What to Expect

- **Event Announcements**: Stay updated on upcoming school events.
- **Council Initiatives**: Learn about what the council is doing to improve student life.
- **Student Voices**: Articles and opinions from the student body.

## Image Support

We can now include images in our posts. They will be rendered with a maximum width of 80% by default, which is great for photos.

### Custom Sizing

If you need an image to be a specific size, you can use HTML tags:

<img src="/assets/img/intermolecular/hydrogen_bond.svg" alt="Small Icon" style="width: 100px;">

## Conclusion

We hope you enjoy this new platform for communication!
